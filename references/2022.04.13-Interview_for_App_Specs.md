- Include feedback system of good/bad for each pattern to do machine learning in the future
- Email patterns to the end user
- Include a statement about how to produce better quality patterns
- Colors included in the project should be allowed to vary from very few (around five) to many (being around 30)
  - Maybe on a sliding scale?
- Cross stictchers often have to color match based on what colors of thread they have in their inventory
  
General cross stitching ideas
- 14 stitches per inch is 14 ada fabric
- The number of stitches will determine the size of the project
- Reduce the number of stitches by 2-3 stitches per side to accommodate hoop sizes
- Hoop sizes might include 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14
